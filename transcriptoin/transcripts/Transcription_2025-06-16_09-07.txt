 I'm going to talk to you about some things I've learned in my journey. Most of them experienced some of my hurt and passing. Many of them I'm still practicing, but all of them I do believe are true. Now, they may be truths to me, but don't think that makes them mine, because you cannot own a truth. So please think of these as signposts, approaches, paradigms that give some science the satisfaction. You're a steal, you're a share, liken to your own lives, you personally apply in your own lives, in your own way, should you choose to. So, here we go. Unbelievable is the stupidest word the dictionary says. It should never come out of our mouths. Think about it. To say, oh wow, what an unbelievable play. It was an unbelievable book, an unbelievable film, an unbelievable act of courage. Really? It may be spectacular, it may be phenomenal, most excellent or outstanding, but unbelievable? Give others and yourself more credit. It just happened. You witnessed it. You just did it. Believe it. Give your obstacles credit. You know, once you do find your frequency on something, go forward if you're non-tyrant and don't ask permission. And that's the not giving a damn part. I found that the world will actually ask and go, yeah, I'll give you a green light on that if you actually go forward and mean it, like you're going to do it by hook or by crook and not ask permission. Life is not easy. It is not. Don't try to make it that way. Life's not fair. It never was. It is now and it won't ever be. Do not fall into the trap, the entitlement trap of feeling like you're a victim. You are not. Get over it. Get on it. And yes, most things are more rewarding when you break a sweat to get them. Sit here in that discomfort long enough to go. Okay. Until you come out the other side to go. All right, I'm good with me again. I don't want to leave a place I traveled to until I get to the point of going, I could live here. This could be my existence. And soon as I get to that point, they don't like, okay, you go. Now I can go. It's the same thing in the personal journey. Stick with it. Do you get through the discomfort to uncomfortable times? Until you go, you know what? I can spend time with myself. I could do this. I could do this forever. Well, then it's okay to go re-engage, pick up your phone, go see your friends, go have a drink, what have you. Go look for those things that are the other relationships in life. But hopefully not until. There's great value in not doing that until you go, I'm good with me and me for right now. So to any of us, whatever those things are, whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasing, to that I say, to that I say, all right, all right, all right. Yeah, I think just keep that. See, happiness is an emotional response to an outcome. If I win, I will be happy. If I don't, I won't. It's an if-then, cause-and-effect, quid pro quo, standard that we cannot sustain because we immediately raise it every time we attain it. See, happiness demands a certain outcome. It is result reliant. And I say, happiness is what you're after. Then you're going to be let down frequently and you're going to be unhappy much of your time. Joy, though. Joy is a different thing. It's something else. Joy is not a choice. It's not a response to some result. It's a constant. Joy is the feeling that we have from doing what we are fashion to do. It is just as important where we are not as it is where we are. Look, the first step that leads to our identity, life, is usually not. I know who I am. I know who I am. That's not the first step. The first step is usually I know who I am not, process of elimination. Defining ourselves by what we are not is the first step that leads us to really know who we are. South of New Orleans a few years ago, and I went to a voodoo shop and had this wooden partition against the wall of these columns. And in these columns were these vials of these magic potions, right? And the headings above each potion defining what they would give you were things like fertility, health, family, legal health, energy, forgiveness, money. Guess which column was empty? Money. Let's admit it. Money is king today. It's what makes the world go round. It is success. The more we have, the more successful we are, right? I would argue that our cultural values have even been financialized. Humility is not a joke anymore. It's too passive to get rich quick on the internet. Rich is 15 minutes of fame world that we live in, and we see it every day. But we all want to succeed, right? So the question that we got to ask ourselves is what success is to us, what success is to you. Is it more money? That's fine. I got nothing against money. No? Maybe it's a healthy family. Maybe it's a happy marriage. Maybe it's to help others, to be famous, be spiritually sound, leave the world a little bit better place than you found. Continue to ask yourself that question. Now your answer may change over time, and that's fine. But do yourself this favor. Whatever your answer is, don't choose anything that will jeopardize yourself. Prioritize who you are, who you want to be, and don't spend time with anything that antagonizes your character. Don't drink the Kool-Aid, man. It tastes sweet, but you will get cavities tomorrow. Alright? Life is not a popularity contest. Be brave, take the hill, but first answer that question, what's my hill? There's a responsibility to freedom, and that there is freedom in responsibility. You know, in the earn your way there. We remember the stuff we earn, the stuff we experience, more than what the teacher tells us or what someone gives us for free. We just do. We broke a proverbial sweat on it, whether it was mental or physical or whatever. We built it. We understand, we felt how we got it, how we achieved it, how we got what we wanted. Those stick with us. Whether we forget them intellectually, they were written in our lineage, and they build resilience, and they build a healthy true optimism going forward to know that, oh no, I've worked for something before and achieved it. Delayed gratification. Oh, there are choices I can make today for myself that will pay me back later in life. So there are choices we make. If you're going to say right now, I'm going to lie cheap and steal to get what I want, and I got it. I got an immediate green light for me. That's a battery-powered green light. That's not a solar-powered green light. Why? Because now, everywhere I go, I got to look over my shoulder to see if someone's there that I lie cheap and stole from. And when I'm doing that, I'm stealing who's time, my time. I'm not free. I don't have the freedom. I didn't create freedom in my future because I chose to be here making irresponsible act that I left drums. I now got reasons to look over my shoulder. And the more things we do to create in our future that we got to look over our shoulder, the more of our most precious thing we have in our life's time that we're stealing from ourselves. So it's not pure tannable. It's just like, it's actually self-serve. It's a very selfish choice. Hey! And I'm a fan of the word selfish. I help redefine it. But I believe that there are selfish choices we can make that are the most self-less. That there are self-less choices that we can make that are the most selfish choices. Those two are not a contradiction and we see it in that way. Responsibility is appreciation of a past. It's building up a lineage. It's investing in ourselves. It's investing in something we started to build yesterday that we want to take into tomorrow. There's a response that gives us freedom. Be brave. Have courage. And when you do, you get stronger. You get more aware. You get more respectful of yourself and that which you fear.
